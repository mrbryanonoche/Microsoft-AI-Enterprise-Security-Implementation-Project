# Microsoft AI Enterprise Security Implementation Project

## üìå Business Case
As AI becomes deeply embedded in enterprise operations, securing AI systems is critical to protect sensitive data, ensure model integrity, and maintain trust. This project establishes a secure foundation for deploying and managing AI workloads using Microsoft‚Äôs AI and security platforms.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Secure AI models, data, and infrastructure across the AI lifecycle
- Implement responsible AI governance and compliance controls
- Detect and mitigate AI-specific threats (e.g., prompt injection, model theft)
- Integrate AI security into existing enterprise security operations

## üßæ Licensing Requirements

| Microsoft Product                  | Purpose                                      | Licensing Notes                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Defender for Cloud      | Threat protection for AI workloads           | Requires Defender for Servers or PaaS plans     |
| Microsoft Purview                 | Data governance and risk management          | Licensed per user or capacity                   |
| Azure OpenAI / Azure AI Services  | AI model hosting and inference               | Pay-as-you-go or commitment tiers               |
| Azure API Management              | Secure AI endpoints and traffic control      | Based on usage and instance size                |
| Microsoft Sentinel                | SIEM/SOAR for AI threat detection            | Pay-per-GB ingestion or capacity reservation    |

**Recommendations:**
- Bundle security tools under Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans
- Use Microsoft Purview for data classification and insider risk management
- Ensure licensing covers all AI environments (cloud, hybrid, on-prem)

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Workflow

1. **Initiate Project**
   - Define AI security goals and success metrics
   - Identify stakeholders: security, data science, compliance, IT

2. **AI Asset Inventory**
   - Catalog AI models, datasets, endpoints, and pipelines
   - Classify data sensitivity using Microsoft Purview

3. **Secure Infrastructure**
   - Apply Azure security baselines to AI services
   - Enable Defender for Cloud for AI-related resources

4. **Model Security & Governance**
   - Implement model verification and version control
   - Use Prompt Shields and output monitoring for generative AI
   - Apply RBAC and API gateway policies to control access

5. **Threat Detection & Response**
   - Integrate AI logs with Microsoft Sentinel
   - Create analytics rules for prompt injection, model abuse, and data exfiltration
   - Enable Defender for Cloud‚Äôs AI threat protection (preview)

6. **Responsible AI Controls**
   - Establish governance board and ethical review process
   - Use Microsoft‚Äôs Responsible AI Standard and assessment tools
   - Document model purpose, limitations, and risk mitigations

7. **Red Teaming & Testing**
   - Conduct adversarial testing (e.g., prompt injection, model inversion)
   - Use tools like PyRIT for automated AI red teaming
   - Simulate misuse scenarios and evaluate model resilience

8. **Training & Awareness**
   - Train developers and data scientists on secure AI practices
   - Educate business users on responsible AI usage

9. **Monitoring & Optimization**
   - Continuously monitor AI workloads and model behavior
   - Review audit logs, alerts, and compliance reports
   - Tune policies and update controls based on threat landscape
